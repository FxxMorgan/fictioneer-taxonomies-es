# Fictioneer Taxonomy Project

The Fictioneer Taxonomy Project is an attempt to make taxonomies for web fictions more conform. This may prove useful to services or tools which offer searchable lists aggregated from different sites. While common terms such as "science fiction" or "fantasy" are well established, derived and associated terms can differ wildly in both spelling and meaning.

This is part of the [Fictioneer](https://github.com/Tetrakern/fictioneer) theme for WordPress.




## Genres
* some genres can be tags as well, like War

### How to properly use genres
Genres are immediately understandable categorizations of stories in regards to content, technique, tone, or sometimes length (e.g. short stories). They are broad in the sense that no one story ever needs to be alike, allowing an infinite number of variations and combinations of tropes — although they usually follow trends. Therefore your choice of genres should describe your story as a whole, not just single occurrences.

For example, the Military genre revolves around the armed forces of countries including their organizations, operations, politics, memoirs, history, and so forth. Or the opposition of thereof. If your fantasy story features a single war at some point but is otherwise about hunting monsters, you should opt for a tag instead.

* choosing a genre is normally straightforward since only few of them apply; even the most epics tend to have core genres in addition to subgenres, which are often better off as tags; having a grand fantasy saga that turns out to incorporate science fiction is still mostly fantasy; also, the extra genre would be a spoiler

## Tags
Tags (in fiction) are keywords or terms associated with commonly agreed upon trappings and tropes. They help with describing, browser, and searching stories. Not to be confused with _genres_, such as “Fantasy” or “Science Fiction” meant for broad categorization, or _fandoms_ which situate a story within a particular intellectual property, such as “Stargate” or the “Marvel Cinematic Universe”. This list is incomplete and always will be incomplete, serving as vocabulary blueprint to add your own tags as needed.

### Considerations and best practices to create tags
* note: tags specific or highly specific; often reflect tropes
* specificity: as specific as necessary to pitch the story but not enough to give away the plot

### How to properly use tags
Tags should be chosen based on their relevance and weighted presence, not added in bulk just to account for every reference or possibility. The “Smartphone” tag is superfluous for stories set in our time, but may be justified if the protagonist retains a working device after being transported into a medieval world. If you end up with half a page of tags or more, better reevaluate your selection. Redundancy should be avoided as well, so when you got “High Fantasy” you don’t need “Fantasy” on top as this is already obvious.

### Wait, where is all the smut?
Most adult tags have been deliberately left out because there are just _too many of them_. Half the list would be nothing but fetishes, kinks, positions, and practices. And let’s be real, do you really need assistance to describe your smut? After years on the Internet, you cannot tell? Because if so, you should probably not write smut fiction in the first place.

### Categories

### Data node example

```json
"siblingRivalry": {
  "aliasOf": "",
  "associations": ["Siblings", "Family", "Brother", "Sister", "Twin", "Heirs"],
  "category": "Family",
  "name": "Sibling Rivalry",
  "parent": "Rivalry",
  "description": "Competition or animosity among siblings, regardless of blood-relation. Reasons may include preferential treatment, the order of succession or inheritance, literal enforced competition, or just petty jealousy."
},
```
